Hey! A few projects I have been working on:

- 🐢 [Infinite Turtles](https://github.com/edsunman/infinite-turtles) is a card game built using Threlte and Svelte 5
- 🎮 [Nightingale](https://github.com/edsunman/nightingale) is a point and click adventure built using Threlte and Svelte 4

- ✨ [Threlte Particles](https://github.com/edsunman/threlte-particles) is a particle emitter for Threlte
- 🎞️ [Threlte Animation Utils](https://gist.github.com/edsunman/a0ff818e5d894bbd1558b3f6038d19ed) are helper functions for creating basic animations in Threlte.
